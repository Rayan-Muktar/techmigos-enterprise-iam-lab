# 🔐 Okta + Zendesk SAML 2.0 Integration

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Okta (Identity Provider)** with **Zendesk (Service Provider)** using **SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

The goal was to centralize authentication, enable secure SSO for Zendesk team members, and gain hands-on experience with enterprise IAM concepts.

# Authentication Flow

## IdP-Initiated

```text
User
   │
   ▼
Okta Dashboard
   │
Launch Zendesk
   │
   ▼
Zendesk
```

---

## SP-Initiated

```text
User
   │
   ▼
Zendesk Login Page
   │
Redirect to Okta
   │
Authenticate
   │
   ▼
Zendesk
```

---

# IAM Concepts Learned

## Identity Provider (IdP)

Okta authenticates users and issues SAML assertions.

---

## Service Provider (SP)

Zendesk trusts Okta and grants access after validating the SAML assertion.

---

## ACS URL

The endpoint where Zendesk receives the SAML assertion.

---

## Certificate Fingerprint

Used by Zendesk to verify that the SAML assertion was signed by Okta.

---

## Remote Logout

Logs users out of both Zendesk and Okta.

---

# Challenges Encountered

- Understanding the difference between the Signing Certificate and the SHA256 Certificate Fingerprint.
- Matching the correct SAML values between Okta and Zendesk.
- Activating SAML through Team Member Authentication after creating the configuration.

---

# Skills Demonstrated

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Okta Administration
- Zendesk Administration
- SAML 2.0
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Identity Federation
- Authentication Policies
- Certificate-Based Trust
- Enterprise Application Integration

---

# Outcome

Successfully configured and activated a working SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On integration between Okta and Zendesk.

The integration enables Zendesk team members to authenticate through Okta while keeping Zendesk authentication available as a backup during testing.
